The Odin Project's Restaurant Page Assignment

General Thoughts: Mini project that introduced how to install and use webpack. After this project, I made a note to make generic functions that might be useful in future projects, and to import those functions when necessary!

What I learned:
    
    - How to install and use webpack
    - Import/export JS functions
    - How to clear child div using `main.replaceChildren();`
    - To use `npx webpack --watch`
